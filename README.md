- 👋 Hi, I’m @UnicornDevCraft
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how does GitHub work and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on educational projects.
- 📫 How to reach me? Drop me a line to ksulivelove@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Unicorn
- ⚡ Fun fact: I dream of implementing my own educational project for both kids and their parents. As I have my own daughter and wish to make her screen time educational, interesting and engaging.
- I will post here all my projects from courses, tutorials and educational videos I`m studying. Not only to show myself how far I`ve come, but also to make a kind reminder that there is nothing impossible.
